## Description

An interactive full stack e-commerce plant store app is a comprehensive digital platform that offers a seamless and engaging experience for users looking to explore, purchase, and manage a wide variety of plants and related products. This application encompasses both the front-end and back-end aspects, combining user-friendly interfaces with robust functionality to create a well-rounded shopping experience. 

Our motivation was to create a full stack e-commerce plant sto app that seamlessly combines user-friendly interfaces with sophisticated back-end functionality, resulting in an immersive and enjoyable platform for plant enthusiasts to explore, shop and connect with the world of plants. 

Our idea for this project was to merge two main apps: an E-Commerce website, and a resource that will give you advice on how to take care of and grow your plants, as we as provide the abiltity to track this information. 

We combined both app ideas and came up with the concenpt of an E-Commerce app that focuses on researching and purchasing plants, as well as incorporating features such as the difficulty levels for each plant, tracking your geo-location to give plant options and suggestions for a specific climate the user may live in.
